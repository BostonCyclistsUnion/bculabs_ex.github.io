I have extensive experience leveraging text data in AI products.  I have given talks on building [Named-Entity Recognition pipelines](https://github.com/bpben/ner_chinese_spacy) in non-English languages, [workshops on applied NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2gcTDdbSp4) and led discussions of the ethical issues facing these technologies.  I teach a course at Harvard on [text analytics and NLP](https://www.summer.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses/text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing/34793).
