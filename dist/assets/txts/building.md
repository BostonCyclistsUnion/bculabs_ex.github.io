I have built data science teams in academia and industry.  I consult with businesses to identify candidates and structure their assessments to identify “do-ers” who can build the stack needed for AI transformation.  I have worked within the major cloud provider and with on-prem systems.  As a team leader, I have established data science workflows that change the way decisions are made.
