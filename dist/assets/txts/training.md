I have led several data science teams in my career, which involved mentoring junior and senior talent.  I focus on building a collaborative relationship, which I find to be rewarding for both myself, my team and the organization at large. I have taught [courses](https://www.summer.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses/text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing/34793) and [workshops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAdHn17IyqA), mentored students in their independent study and gotten involved in the larger tech [community](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Boston-Cambridge/).
