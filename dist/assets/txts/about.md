I am a full-stack data scientist specializing in Natural Language Processing.
                                            I build and
                                            lead analytics teams, scope and execute projects for organization-wide
                                            impact. I subscribe to
                                            the DJ Patil adage “move purposefully and fix things”. In my view, no
                                            solution can be implemented without buy-in and no buy-in can be achieved
                                            without
                                            communication and trust.</p>

### My Story

I’ve been working in data science since 2014, but I've been exploring stories in data throughout my life.  I began as a student of comparative literature and history, exploring compositional techniques and how they track onto larger trends in their physical and intellectual environment.

An interest in measurement and evaluation led me to study public health at Johns Hopkins, where I studied how the environment influences mental and physical health.  I carried out investigations of [food environments](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03670244.2012.705732) and [evaluated interventions to promote healthy behavior](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816610/).

I continued the study of interventions and causal models by pursuing a PhD in Policy Analysis at the [RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/).  While at RAND, I worked on projects evaluating [infrastructure policies](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1200/RR1224/RAND_RR1224) and [workplace health programs](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.4278/ajhp.150210-QUAN-718)

At RAND, I began using "real world" datasets to expand the scope of my research. I used [social media data to investigate public discussion of health](https://www.rwjf.org/en/cultureofhealth/about.html) and [voter file data to score individual likelihood to vote](https://github.com/DerekKaknes/voter_karma). I open datasets and technology enabled answering difficult research questions and supported development of [impactful and scalalable data products](https://github.com/bpben/crash-model).

Since then I've worked in government, industry and academia.  I've tackled ambitious initiatives like [building a predictive pipeline for health inspections](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2016/08/18/the-power-of-learning), [creating AI products to guide local businesses in their marketing efforts](https://thrivehive.com/press-media/answer-the-locals-the-most-asked-questions-from-your-prospective-customers/) and [estimating a customer's budget based on their historical spend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ym4fzPfraw).

Throughout my career, I’ve participated in the community by [hosting speakers and workshops on open source topics](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Boston-Cambridge/), [engaging in civic technology projects](https://github.com/bpben/crash-model) and [sharing my expertise in the area of Natural Language Processing](https://www.summer.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses/text-analytics-and-natural-language-processing/34793).
